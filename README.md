Design and Development of Multimodal Authentication Approach
Project Overview
The "Design and Development of Multimodal Authentication Approach" project aims to create a robust and secure authentication system using four different modalities. This AI/ML-based IoT project integrates face recognition, email OTP, password authentication, and fingerprint scanning to control access to a secure area through a microcontroller-operated door mechanism.

Features
Face Recognition:

Utilizes a camera to capture the user's face.
Compares the captured face with stored embeddings for authentication.
Email OTP:

Generates a one-time password (OTP).
Sends the OTP to the user's registered email address.
User must enter the OTP for the next step.
Password Authentication:

User enters a pre-registered password.
Validates the password against stored credentials.
Fingerprint Scanning:

Utilizes a fingerprint sensor to capture the user's fingerprint.
Compares the fingerprint with stored data for authentication.
Sends a signal to a microcontroller to open the door upon successful authentication.
System Architecture
User Interface:

Camera for face recognition.
Input fields for OTP and password.
Fingerprint sensor for fingerprint scanning.
Backend Processing:

AI/ML algorithms for face recognition.
Email service for OTP generation and dispatch.
Secure database for storing user credentials (images, embeddings, passwords, fingerprint data).
Microcontroller Integration:

Receives signals from the authentication system.
Controls the door mechanism (e.g., opening/closing the door).
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, C/C++ (for microcontroller programming)
Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV (for face recognition), smtplib (for sending emails), Flask/Django (for backend development)
Hardware: Camera, Fingerprint sensor, Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
AI/ML Models: Pre-trained models for face recognition (e.g., Haar Cascades, Dlib)
AI/ML Models: pyttsx3 for text-to-speech

Usage Instructions
Face Recognition:

Position your face in front of the camera.
The system will capture and verify your face against stored embeddings.
OTP Verification:

Check your registered email for the OTP.
Enter the OTP in the provided field.
Password Authentication:

Enter your registered password in the provided field.
Fingerprint Scanning:

Place your finger on the fingerprint sensor.
Upon successful verification, the microcontroller will trigger the door mechanism to open.
